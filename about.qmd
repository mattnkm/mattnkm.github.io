::: {#hero-heading}
I'm a data scientist and Scientia Fellow (woo!) at the [City Futures Research Centre](https://cityfutures.ada.unsw.edu.au/). I grew up in Brunei until I was 18, then spent most of my life in London and Sydney.

I work on a whole bunch of projects, mostly focusing on urban analytics and property market analysis. I also do a lot of consulting on data, tech development, and analytics through the research centre (reach out [here](https://cityfutures.ada.unsw.edu.au/about-us/our-profiles/matthew-ng/)).

I love learning about urban systems and modeling them, and I care deeply about issues like housing, affordability, and accessibility.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually out running, trying insufferably to make it my defining trait.
