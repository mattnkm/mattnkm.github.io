The main question is whether we should let these temporary residents stay as permanent residents or even citizens to keep our population and workforce stable. If we need these workers long-term to support the economy, what are the effects of integrating them into our society? Are we ready to support their integration, and will they fit into the community in a way that feels right to Bruneians?\nAlso, since many of these temporary residents spend most of their prime working years in Brunei, should there be a way for them to become citizens since they’ve contributed to nation-building? How will our migration policies change, especially as our mostly young Bruneian population gets older and starts filling these age groups/labour roles?\nGoing back to the original question: why aren’t there more locals running their own businesses? Maybe Thomas was only seeing part of the picture. It’s tough to say since there are many factors at play. It seems to be a mix of having a young local population and a cultural aversion for front-facing or physical labor roles. It would be interesting to find out which parts of the workforce these temporary residents are in—especially the men. What industries are they in, and are they taking on roles that the local (predominantly male) workforce can’t handle?"
